General
  Error body not consistent, i.e. an endpoint that is not enabled returns:
        {
          "status" : "401",
          "message" : "Bad Credentials"
        }

        rather than:

        {
          "errorCode" : "401",
          "errorMsg" : "Bad Credentials"
        }

  Consider returning 403 and 404 rather than 401 for disabled and wrong endpoints uris respectively - would help developers.

Group
  List Group -  just before the Add Group title there is URL for location/category - is that meant to be group/{groupId}?
  Add Group -  response example missing quotes on vehicleIds and personIds individual ids in list, i.e. "personIds": ["347626,347627"] should be "personIds": ["347626", "347627"] - doc error?
  Update Group -  response example missing quotes on vehicleIds and personIds individual ids in list - doc error?
